## Student Deliverables

During the semester, student submitted four forms of deliverables. Written feedback was given from the instructor or teaching assistant on the first three categories of assignment.

1.  {{< anchor "1" >}}{{< /anchor >}}*Three Team Writing Assignments*   
      
    *The Essays*: Team-prepared essays should be 3–4 pages in length, typed and double-spaced. Each of these essays is worth 5% of your individual grade; all members of the team will receive the same grade. We will impose a grading penalty for work delivered after the deadline.   
      
    *Team Process*: Teams of 5 students each will be randomly composed by the end of week 2; these teams will continue for the entire semester. Each 5-person team will be responsible for writing three papers: The team should indicate that all members have contributed to the paper through either writing or reflection or both; teams should indicate if one or more members have not contributed; those who don't will earn a "0" for that assignment.   
     
2. {{< anchor "2" >}}{{< /anchor >}}*One Team Co-teaching Exercise*   
      
    The team will also be responsible for co-leading one full class, to be selected by the team during the third week of the semester which is worth 10% of your grade. Again, that grade will apply to the entire team, except for any team member(s) who didn't contribute to the preparatory effort, and who will therefore receive a "0" for that assignment. A full description of the rationale for and logistics of the exercise can be found here: {{% resource_link 4ec4154a-75e0-2e2b-a1a3-bd9f74e134c9 "Co-teaching Assignment" %}}.   
     
3. {{< anchor "3" >}}{{< /anchor >}}*Two Individual Papers*   
      
    These essays are to be written solo, in response to topics. The first, mid-term paper should be 5–7 pages in length, typed and double-spaced, and is worth 15% of your grade. The second, final paper should be 5–7 pages in length, typed and double-spaced, and is worth 20% of your grade. All work on these two essays should be the product of the individual student's thought and writing process. We will impose a grading penalty for work delivered after the deadline.   
     
4. {{< anchor "4" >}}{{< /anchor >}}*Participation*   
      
    We will conduct 15.269 as a moderated discussion, which reproduces the search for consensus that good story-telling typically generates in the workplace. Regular attendance and active engagement in the conversation makes a significant difference for all parties, in that you stand to learn as much from your classmates as from the faculty or the material. Participation counts for 40% of your grade.

## Feedback

The professor or TA will provide written feedback on all of the written assignments and the co-teaching exercise; we aim to provide feedback within 5–7 days on the team exercises, and two weeks on the individual written assignments; at mid-term, we will alert students to lagging participation grades. On all assignments, we are happy to follow up with face-to-face discussions, as needed.
